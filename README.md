# Discrete-Choice-Model

An R Implementation of Discrete Choice Models with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (Chipman et. al, 2010). Ten benchmark datasets are used to compare BART with a Multinomial Logit model with varying coefficients for every choice alternative and a Multinomial log-linear Neural Network.
An R implementation of a multinomial monotone BART model (Chipman et. al, 2016) is also presented. This code is suitably adapted from the R package Monotone BART (Chipman et. al, 2016).
